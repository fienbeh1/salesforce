// Manipulate Records with DML

//URL {https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=9060G000000XdsIQAS}
//To pass this challenge, create an Apex class that inserts a new account named after an incoming parameter. If the account is successfully inserted, the method should return the account record. If a DML exception occurs, the method should return null.
//The Apex class must be called AccountHandler and be in the public scope
//The Apex class must have a public static method called insertNewAccount
//The method must accept an incoming string as a parameter, which will be used to create the Account name
//The method must insert the account into the system and then return the record
//The method must also accept an empty string, catch the failed DML and then return null



public class AccountHandler 
{
    public static Account insertNewAccount(String name)
    {
        Account newAccount = new Account(Name=name);
        try{
        insert newAccount;
       
        }catch(Exception e)
        {
            return null;
        }
         return newAccount;
    }
}

/*Pass below to test the class in dubug window : 

Account showAccount = new Account();
showAccount = AccountHandler.insertNewAccount('SFDC New Account');
System.debug('New Account Name: '+showAccount);*/

We can also solve this challenge without using the try cath exceptions as,
public class AccountHandler {
    public static Account insertNewAccount(String AccountName) {
        if(AccountName.length()>=1){
            Account acc = new Account(Name=AccountName);
            insert acc;
            return acc;
        }
        else {
                return null;      
               }
        }
}
//To verify enter this line of code in Execute Anonymous window:
AccountHandler.insertNewAccount('trailhead');
